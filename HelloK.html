<h3><img src="info.gif"> Radio friendly song!<acronym>WTF</acronym>

<p>It starts soft like a thousand<br>
other songs that you've heard before<br>
Except in this one they do a little<br>
du-du-du-du-DU-dum-du-du<br>

<p title="voruj i ubivaj">So you try to change the station<br>
but it's playing on every one<br>
A bunch shitty-ass chords and lyrics<br>
recorded by a fucking moron<br>

<p> And you assume the the general public<br>
is not that stupid<br>
You're positive that nobody will want<br>
to listen to this<br>
But you are wrong<br>

<p>They wanna know the stupid<br>
motherfucking lame cock-sucking<br>
cookie cutter radio friendly song<br>
And everyone sings along in their cars<br>

<p>and at the mall<br>
And at the office they all love the new<br>
radio friendly song<br>
