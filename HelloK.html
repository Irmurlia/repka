<h3><img src="info.gif"> <cite> Radio friendly song!</cite><acronym>WTF</acronym></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0Gs4xGw1Eg"> YouTube song</a></p>

<p><tt>It starts soft like a thousand</tt><br>
<DFN>other songs that you've heard before</DFN><br>
Except in this one they do a little<br>
<KBD>du-du-du-du-DU-dum-du-du</KBD><br>

<p title="voruj i ubivaj">So you try to change the station<br>
but it's playing on every one<br>
A bunch shitty-ass chords and lyrics<br>
recorded by a <em>fucking moron</em><br>

<p> And you assume the the general public<br>
is not that stupid<br>
<strong>You're positive that nobody will want</strong><br>
to listen to this<br>
But you are wrong<br>

<p>They wanna know the stupid<br>
motherfucking lame cock-sucking<br>
cookie cutter radio friendly song<br>
And everyone sings along in their cars<br>

<p>and at the mall<br>
And at the office they all love the new<br>
radio friendly song<br>
<p><samp>ae</samp> it like &aelig;<br>

<p><STRONG>You should write</STRONG>	
<pre>cp <var>sourse-point</var> <var>dest-point</var></pre>
replasing the <var>sourse-point</var> with the name of the source point, and <var>desk-point</var> with the name of the destination point.
