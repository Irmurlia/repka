<p align=center>It starts soft like a thousand<br>
other songs that you've heard before
<p align=left>Except in this one they do a little
<p align=right>du-du-du-du-DU-dum-du-du<br>

So you try to change the station<br>
but it's playing on every one<br>
A bunch shitty-ass chords and lyrics<br>
recorded by a fucking moron<br>

<p><H1>And you assume the the general public</h1><br>
<h2>is not that stupid</h2><br>
<h3>You're positive that nobody will want</h3><br>
<h4>to listen to this</h4><br>
<h5>But you are wrong<h5><br>

<h6>They wanna know the stupid</h6><br>
motherfucking lame cock-sucking<br>
cookie cutter radio friendly song<br>
And everyone sings along in their cars<br>

<p>and at the mall<br>
And at the office they all love the new<br>
radio friendly song<br>
