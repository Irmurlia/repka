<h3><img src="info.gif"> <cite> Radio friendly song!</cite><acronym>WTF</acronym></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0Gs4xGw1Eg"> YouTube song</a></p>

<p><tt>It starts soft like a thousand</tt><br>
<DFN>other songs that you've heard before</DFN><br>
Except in this one they do a little<br>
<KBD>du-du-du-du-DU-dum-du-du</KBD><br>

<p title="voruj i ubivaj">So you try to change the station<br>
but it's playing on every one<br>
A bunch shitty-ass chords and lyrics<br>
recorded by a <em>fucking moron</em><br>

<p> And you assume the the general public<br>
is not that stupid<br>
<strong>You're positive that nobody will want</strong><br>
to listen to this<br>
But you are wrong<br>

<p>They wanna know the stupid<br>
motherfucking lame cock-sucking<br>
cookie cutter radio friendly song<br>
And everyone sings along in their cars<br>

<p>and at the mall<br>
And at the office they all love the new<br>
radio friendly song<br>
<p><samp>ae</samp> it like &aelig;<br>

<p><STRONG>You should write</STRONG>	
<pre>cp <var>sourse-point</var> <var>dest-point</var></pre>
replasing the <var>sourse-point</var> with the name of the source point, and <var>desk-point</var> with the name of the destination point.

<p>Un-o-ri-gi-nal me-lo-dy

<p>Why did <sub>John</sub> <sup>Lennon </sup>have to be the one<br>
to get shot<a href="https://www.google.ru/search?q=get+shot&newwindow=1&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi1kI_xhtvdAhXChaYKHZ4TD4kQ_AUICigB&biw=1374&bih=767&dpr=1#imgrc=-y_4Gmfycu0XKM:"><sup><small>777</small></sup> </a>, something's wrong<br>
While these douche bags are all still alive<br>
singing these ass-licking songs<br>

<p>All these fucking unoriginal pussies<br>
that don't have anything to say<br>
I'm not homophobic, but this song is<br>
so fucking gay<br>

<p>You can barely retain the vomit<br>
that's raising in your throat<br>
And you assume that everyone will think<br>
that this song is terrible<br>
<u>But you are wrong</u><br>

<p>They wanna know the stupid<br>
motherfucking lame cock-sucking<br>
cookie cutter radio friendly song<br>
And everyone sings along in their cars<br>
and at the mall<br>
And at the office they all love the new<br>
radio friendly ...<br>

<p>Piece of shit<br>
oh what a sucky-ass piece of shit<br>
I'd rather shoot myself in the face<br>
than listen to this<br>
corporate bitch singing this<br>
stupid motherfucking lame cock-sucking<br>
cookie cutter radio friendly piece of shit<br>

<p>God I hate this shit!<br>
